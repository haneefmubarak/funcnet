funcnet
=======

A language that maps functions against a dimensional net of bits

What does that mean?
====================

Think of it as a logic simulator with an exception: instead of 
preset gates and modules, its more of a procedural processing 
language that allows you to read and write to memory bits.

You can actually output bits to the console, or even output
characters by selecting a set of bits (ie: a multiple of bytes)
and using the output function.
